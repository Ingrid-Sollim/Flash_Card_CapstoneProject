# Flash_Card_CapstoneProject
Lesson 31 from Python with Angela Yu\
This project creates a Flash card game, where the user guesses the translation of a word, after 3 seconds the translation appears in the interface. If the user guessed right, He/She can click on the green buttom, if guessed wrong, He/She can click on the red buttom. All the right guesses are removed from the list of words, so the user can practice only with the words He/She doesn't know.\
